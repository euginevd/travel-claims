# Security policy

**Found a vulnerability? Report it privately, and we'll work with you to fix it before anyone else hears about it.**

[Report](#report) · [What happens next](#what-happens-next) · [Scope](#scope)

</div>

## Report

1. Don't open a public issue, PR or discussion.
2. Report it privately: the repo's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Include what you found, how to reproduce it, and the impact you expect.

## What happens next

1. A reply within 5 working days, confirming whether it's a vulnerability.
2. A fix within 30 days for a high or critical issue, or a plan with a date if it needs longer.
3. A security advisory once it's fixed, crediting you unless you'd rather not be named.

## Scope

1. **In scope:** the `main` branch only: the code, workflows, scripts and infrastructure as code.
2. **Out of scope:** findings already accepted in [guides/03-security-trade-offs.md](guides/03-security-trade-offs.md), the fictional course data in `data/`, and anything that needs a compromised GitHub or AWS account to begin with.
3. **Testing:** test against your own copy, never someone else's deployment, and don't access or keep anyone's data. Research in good faith under this policy won't be pursued.
